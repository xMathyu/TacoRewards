# Production Deployment Fix

## Problem
The Discord bot was failing in Railway production with multiple errors:

1. **Initial Error**: `Cannot find module '@/database/connection'`
2. **Secondary Error**: `Cannot find module 'file:///app/dist/commands/...`

The first issue was TypeScript path mapping (aliases like `@/`) not working in production.
The second issue was using `pathToFileURL` with `import()` which doesn't work well with `module-alias` in Linux containers.

## Solution
Implemented `module-alias` package and switched from dynamic imports to require() for better compatibility.

### Changes Made

1. **Added module-alias dependency**
   - Added `module-alias: ^2.2.3` to dependencies
   - Added `@types/module-alias: ^2.0.4` to devDependencies

2. **Configured package.json**
   - Added `_moduleAliases` configuration mapping `@` to `dist`
   - Updated start scripts to use `-r module-alias/register`

3. **Updated TypeScript entry point**
   - Added `import 'module-alias/register'` as the first import in `src/index.ts`

4. **Fixed command/event loaders**
   - **Removed `pathToFileURL` and dynamic imports**: Replaced with `require()` for better `module-alias` compatibility
   - **Updated filters**: Exclude `.d.ts` files: `(file.endsWith('.ts') || file.endsWith('.js')) && !file.endsWith('.d.ts')`
   - **Changed to synchronous**: Functions are now sync instead of async

5. **Optimized Dockerfile**
   - Added non-root user for security
   - Improved caching with proper layer ordering
   - Updated npm commands for better compatibility

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Linux vs Windows**: `pathToFileURL` creates different URL formats on Linux containers
- **Module Resolution**: `module-alias` works better with `require()` than `import()`
- **TypeScript Compilation**: `.d.ts` files were being treated as executable modules

## Verification
- âœ… Module aliases now work in production
- âœ… Database connection successful
- âœ… All 3 commands load correctly
- âœ… All 2 events load correctly
- âœ… Ready for Railway deployment

## Scripts
- `npm run build` - Compiles TypeScript
- `npm start` - Runs in production with module-alias support
- `npm run start:prod` - Explicit production mode
- `npm run dev` - Development mode (unchanged)

## Expected Railway Output
```
info: ðŸŒ® Initializing TacoBot...
info: âœ… Database connection established
info: âœ… Successfully loaded 3 commands
info: âœ… Successfully loaded 2 events
info: ðŸŽ‰ TacoBot is now online and ready to serve tacos!
```

The bot should now deploy successfully on Railway without any module resolution errors.
